# OmniRoute

Local setup for [OmniRoute](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute), an open-source AI
gateway that aggregates 290+ AI providers (90+ with free tiers) behind a single
OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

## Install

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
npm start
```

This launches OmniRoute via its `omniroute` CLI. The dashboard is available at
`http://localhost:20128` once the process is running.

## Usage

1. Open the dashboard and connect a provider (e.g. a free-tier provider such as Kiro AI or
   OpenCode Free).
2. Point your IDE or tool (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, etc.) at `http://localhost:20128/v1`
   with an API key generated from the dashboard.
3. Set the model to `auto` to let OmniRoute route requests across providers with intelligent
   fallback and cost optimization.

## Alternatives

- **Global CLI**: `npm install -g omniroute && omniroute`
- **Docker**: `docker run -d -p 127.0.0.1:20128:20128 diegosouzapw/omniroute:latest`

See the [upstream repository](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute) for full
documentation.

## Claude-Mem

[Claude-Mem](https://github.com/thedotmack/claude-mem) is set up here too — a persistent memory
compression system that carries context across Claude Code sessions.

```bash
npm run mem:install   # npx claude-mem install, then restart Claude Code
npm run mem:status    # worker status
npm run mem:doctor    # diagnose install/runtime health
```

See [docs/claude-mem.md](docs/claude-mem.md) for install alternatives, the full command list,
configuration, and troubleshooting.
